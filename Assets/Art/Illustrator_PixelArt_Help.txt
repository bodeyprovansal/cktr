Set Artboard and image size to desired scale (the exact size doesn't 
matter too much since it's a vector image.)

Create Rectangular grid, found under line tool. Click anywhere on image,
set size of grid and number of dividers (# of dividers is one less
that number of boxes). Align grid with artboard. 

Create Live Paint bucket. Found under some tool that I forgot the name of. 
With the grid selected, and live paint bucket activated, click on the grid to 
assign bucket to grid. 

Set your color and paint. 

When done, set the stroke color of the grid to transparent(white w/
a red line through it) To see what it looks like without it. 

note: all things painted on the grid will be more or less attached to it.
